Virtual CV for Wicus Luwes

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a moving tabs.

The first tab has a short description or about section.
The second tab has an Education section
The third tab has an Experience section

The app detects the screen size. If the screen size resembles a mobile screen size, it displays a mobile version of the CV.
