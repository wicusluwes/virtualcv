Virtual CV for Wicus Luwes

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create moving tabs.

The first tab has a short description or 'About' section.
The second tab has an 'Education' section.
The third tab has an 'Experience' section.

The app detects the screen size. 
If the screen size resembles a mobile screen size, it displays a mobile version of the CV.
